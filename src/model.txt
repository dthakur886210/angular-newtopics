model --> model is the one which defines the data structure. 
lets we have an object {name : 'deepak', id : 100}
mostly use for decreasing the chances of error like we should take the numeric part in id and if we will take
string part it will tell us that we are doing something mistake,
model is not a part of angular and it is the part of typescript....


Routing Module : first we defined all routing in app-routing.module.ts 
but we can place routing as per modules in different modules 
sometimes we have many modules, and there will be many routes, so we don't want to route them all together,
to save load from application
ng g m modulename --routing and change there from root to child in module
